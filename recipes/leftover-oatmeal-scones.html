    <h2>A perfect winter snack</h2>
    <p>Every weekday morning in the winter I make oatmeal for my kids. They eat it blindly as they wake up and it's a warm to the day, but how much I make and they eat varies since I am eyeballing everything with groggy eyes. </p>
    <p>With the appetites of these teens and a preteen growing constantly, I decided to start turning these into scones. Something I did when they were little and completely forgot about. Warm with a drizzle of honey, these are a nice addition to their lunch or afters school snack.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked oatmeal</li>
        <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup unbleached flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>4 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter and honey together, and pour them over the cool, cooked oatmeal. Add in the milk and whisk this mixture together until it's evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients. You may want to adjust the salt depending on how salty your oatmeal was.</li>
        <li>Combine the two mixtures with a wooden spoon. If it seems too moist, add a little more flour. You want the dough to form a rough ball.</li>
        <li>Scoop it up in your hands and gently pat into a nice circle about an inch thick on a cookie sheet well greased with butter. If the dough still seems really sticky, dust it with some more flour until you can pat the surface down smooth. Cut into 8 wedges. </li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20-25 minutes, or  until nicely browned on top (but not too dark). You need to enjoy these while still warm, so the butter will melt.</li>
    </ol>
