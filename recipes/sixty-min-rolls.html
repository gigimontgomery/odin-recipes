    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>¼ cup margarine or butter</li>
        <li>4-5 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 pkgs active dry yeast or 4 1/2 teaspoons</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine milk, water and butter in small saucepan. Heat over low heat until liquids are very warm to the touch, about 120 degrees, butter does not need to melt completely. In mixer bowl, place 3 cups of the flour, along with the remaining dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until well blended. Gradually add the warm milk mixture. Mix until well blended.</li>
        <li>Gradually begin adding the remaining 1-2 cups of flour, ½ cup at a time, until the dough is firm, clings to the hook, and cleans the sides of the bowl. Turn out onto counter top and knead a few times.</li>
        <li>Place in a large greased bowl and allow to rise ina warm place for 20 minutes. Turn out, and divide into rolls or loaves, whichever you choose. Place bread in a warm place and allow to rise for another 20-30 minutes. Bake in a 425° oven for 10-12 minutes until golden brown. Brush with butter while still warm to produce a nice soft crust.</li>
